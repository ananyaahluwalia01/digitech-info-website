        <p>Digital technologies focus on understanding, developing and using digital software, hardware and electronic systems across a range of contexts including school, the home and wider community settings. Students develop understandings and skills related to producing quality digital outcomes or environments.</p>
        <p>Digital technologies is studied across a series of topics (or “strands”) and these are</p>
        
        
        <h3>Digital Information</h3>

                  width="500">
        <p>Knowledge of digital information management focuses on how information is managed at both an individual user level and with shared information within an organisation. Initially students learn about basic concepts of information management in relation to producing digital information outcomes. This includes understanding the key features of operating systems and common application software, file management procedures, and ethical issues related to the management of information.</p>
        <p>Apply digital information management tools to create a digital information outcome requires students to create a digital information outcome that involves manipulating and combining data from more than one application. The specifications for the digital information outcome, software and techniques to be used need to be determined prior to the outcome being made.</p>

    
        

        <h3>Digital Media</h3>

        <p>Knowledge of digital media focuses on understanding of concepts of digital media that need to be considered when developing digital media outcomes. Initially students learn about basic concepts of digital media.
        <p>Create a digital media outcome requires students to  construct a digital media outcome that integrates media types and incorporates original content. The specifications for the digital media outcome, software and techniques to be used need to be determined prior to the outcome being made.</p>
    

       <h3>Computer Science and Programming</h3>

        <p>Computer science and software engineering refers to a group of concepts associated with the discipline of computer science and how they are applied in user interfaces.
        <p>Design a software program focuses on designing the structure of a software programs. Initially students learn to specify variables and their data types, construct flexible and robust plans, and determine structures that combine well-chosen actions, conditions and control structures that provide well-structured logical solution to tasks.
        <p>Construct a software program focuses on constructing a computer program for a specified task including testing and debugging the program to ensure the program works correctly.</p>

        <p>Knowledge of electronic environments focuses on the concepts and operational function of components that underpin the understanding of how electronic environments (functional combinations of hardware and embedded software in the real world, that is circuits, prototypes or products) are developed, assembled, and tested. </p>
        <p>Environments (functional combinations of hardware and embedded software in the real world i.e. circuits, prototypes or products) work in terms of their components, subsystems and software and how these components may be selected, subsystems put together and the hardware and software tested and debugged so that the electronic environment is functional with respect to agreed specifications.
        <p>The assembly and testing of electronic and embedded system is focused on developing the skills needed to integrate technologies (hardware, software, mechanical) to produce a working prototype. These skills follow directly from those acquired during the development of an electronic environment as a functional model. It is also about the application of testing, debugging and modification skills to ensure the prototype is operational, fit for purpose and meets specifications.</p>

        <p>Knowledge of digital infrastructure focuses on the concepts of digital infrastructure within personal computers, local area networks (LANs) and Wide Area Networks (WANs).
        <p>Design a digital infrastructure system refers to the assembly and management of a specified system.</p>

        <p>At Dio we focus on aspects of Digital Media, Computer Science and Programming,  and database applications from the Digital Information strands. However, students are free to explore a context which interests them, and if a student wishes to explore her creative digital work in web design, motion graphics, digital video or audio, then a pathway exists for everyone. Similarly students wishing to explore aspects of Digital Information or other strands (eg Digital Infrastructure) not normally covered in existing courses can, with approval from the Faculty leaders, have a course tailored to them. </p>

        <p>The range of programming languages and opportunities are many and varied. Currently Python, HTML5, CSS3, PHP, MySQL, Jquery and JavaScript are all covered in various courses. </p>
        <p>In Digital Media students can choose to use open source tools to assist them in their creation of products, or they can use commercial software such as the Adobe CC suite which at time of writing (2016) is available for an annual fee of around $40. Students are not disadvantaged by their choice of software.</p>

        <h2>Why should you  take Digital Technologies in school?</h2>

        <p>Digital Technologies is an academic subject. Because of how new Digital Technologies is in schools, it is not yet a well known subject, and parents may be wondering whether or not their child should take it in high school. Some parents might also be concerned that NCEA lists Digital Technologies under "Technology" - a field that is thought of by some as being less academic. This has lead to some misunderstanding about what Digital Technologies involves, and which students it is aimed at. Despite the misconceptions, Digital Technologies is best suited to students who enjoy academic subjects and who are good at critical thinking and problem solving.
        </p>
        <p>As society increasingly relies upon computers, people with the skills to actually write the programs that computers run are an essential. Students who enjoy and do well in Digital Technologies subjects will be able to go on to complete tertiary degrees in Information Technology (IT) subjects such as Computer Science, Software Engineering, Web Development, Network Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Database Administration. New Zealand has a long term shortage of graduates with these skills, so those that do have them have a good chance of getting a well paying job from their degree.</p>

        <p>Although doing Digital Technologies in school is not essential to go onto tertiary study in IT, many universities in New Zealand now offer special accelerated programmes for first year Computer Science students who did Digital Technology in high school. In these programmes, students get to do more exciting things in their first year, and are better prepared to do industry internships early in their degree. </p>
        <p>Despite being listed under "Technology", Digital Technologies is a highly academic subject, just like more traditional subjects such as Chemistry and Physics. New Zealand needs many more of the best and brightest young people to go into IT and fill the many challenging and exciting jobs it offers.</p>
        <p>From 2017 Digital Technologies is recognised as a separate Table B subject in its own right by the University of Auckland, meaning a student can use their results to help them gain access to restricted entry courses. </p>
